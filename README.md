TimeSync is the OSU Open Source Lab's time tracking system. It's designed to be
simple, have a sane API, and make sense while allowing users to track their
time spent on various projects and activities.

Usage
-----

To start a local instance running on port 8000, just run:

```
$ npm install
$ TIMESYNC_AUTH_MODULES='["password"]' npm run devel
```

``npm run devel`` is a convenience that will automatically restart the server
every time source files are changed. The standard ``npm start`` still works,
and will not restart the server automatically.

To run the test suite and linter run:

```
$ npm test
$ npm run linter
```

To run a subset of the tests:

```
$ npm test -- -g <substring of test description>
$ npm test -- -g POST   # Runs all tests with POST in the `describe` string
```

To make a quick request on the dev instance, first run the database migrations
and load the fixtures:

```
$ npm run migrations
$ npm run fixtures
```

Next, run the application:

```
$ TIMESYNC_AUTH_MODULES='["password"]' npm start
```

Then, in another terminal, make a request to the application with curl.

(*Piping it to python makes the output pretty.*)

```
$ curl -XGET -s localhost:8000/v1/times | python -m json.tool
[
    {
        "activity": [
            "dev"
        ],
        "created_at": null,
        "date_worked": null,
        "duration": 12,
        "id": 1,
        "issue_uri": "https://github.com/osu-cass/whats-fresh-api/issues/56",
        "notes": "",
        "project": [
            "wf"
        ],
        "updated_at": null,
        "user": "tschuy"
    }
]

```

Your output should look something like the above.

Documentation
-------------

More in-depth documentation can be found inside the ``docs/`` folder. To build
the docs, build them with sphinxdocs by running the following:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cd docs
[docs]$ make html
[docs]$ <browser> build/html/index.html
```

API Specification
------------------

The API docs are a git submodule. Before building them you need to initialize
the submodule with the following commands:

```
The following command initializes the empty submodule:
$ git submodule update --init timesync-api
The following command updates the submodule (when the remote repo gets updated):
$ git submodule update timesync-api
```

To build the api specification docs run the following commands (it is very
similar to building the timesync-node docs):

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cd timesync-api
[timesync-api]$ make html
[timesync-api]$ <browser> build/html/index.html
```

Authentication
--------------

Authentication is handled with a number of "modules", including simple password-
based, LDAP, and possibly more in the future. To use an authentication module,
set the environment variable ``TIMESYNC_AUTH_MODULES`` to a JSON list containing
the plugin names you wish to enable. Note that some types of authentication may
require additional settings (see below).

If the ``TIMESYNC_AUTH_MODULES`` variable is empty, password-based
authentication will be enabled as a default. Invalid module names are ignored.

**Possible options**:
  * ``password`` for simple password-based authentication
  * ``ldap`` for LDAP-based authentication

ex: to enable only LDAP authentication, set ``TIMESYNC_AUTH_MODULES`` to
``["ldap"]``. To enable both local password and LDAP, set it to
``["password","ldap"]``. Order does not matter.

To use LDAP authentication, there are two additional environment variables that
need to be set:

1. ``TIMESYNC_LDAP_URL``: the URL of the LDAP server to connect to, ex.
  ``ldaps://ldap.osuosl.org``.
2. ``TIMESYNC_LDAP_SEARCH_BASE``: the search parameter used to find users,
  ex. ``ou=People,dc=osuosl,dc=org``
