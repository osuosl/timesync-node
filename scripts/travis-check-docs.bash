# Hello future developers! You are probably wondering whose stupid idea it was
# to write this script, you just want to get your tests to pass and your code
# to merge. An excellent sentiment! However, consider the state of the project
# as a whole. You will probably be at the lab for a relatively short time, so
# please be considerate of those who come after you.



# Travis CI runs some commands which look kind of like this. We rely on the
# repo having a merge commit as the most recent commit.
# If Travis changes the way it starts up this script might break. Don't
# despair! You'll probably only need to change PARENT_1 and PARENT_2 below,
# everything else should work fine.
