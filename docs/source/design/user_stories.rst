User Stories

Inputting time:
---------------

* As a developer, I want to be able to securely log in to 
  timesync, so that we know who (authenticate) is using it and that 
  the data is valid
* As a developer, I want to have a username that is separate from 
  my given first and last name (for instance, I use my middle name
  or irc nick more often than my first name, so want to be found in 
  the database by that handle), and that is associated with my 
  github account
* As a developer I want to be able to authenticate using github 
* As a manager, I want to be able to find the users official first
  and last name for any official (billing or documentation) purposes
  that I might need it for.
* As a manager, I want to be able to associate a user with a 
  particular project so that I can know which projects are being 
  worked on by whom.
* As a manager, I want to know which team a user is on so that I can 
  determine which teams are spending the most resources on a 
  particular project and be able to filter by students or full-time
  staff.
* As a manager, I want to know how much time a particular person has
  spent on a particular project for billing purposes
* As a manager, I want to know how much time has collectively been
  spent on a particular project
* As a manager, I want to know which issue (and how many) a user is
  currently working on so that I can hold them accountable for said
  issues and know if they have too much on their plate.
